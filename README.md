# The Covid19 Project with Chest X-Rays 

The Covid19 pandenmic has changed the world.  When Covid hit the U.S.A in March of 2020, everything shut down.  

I think all of us can relate.  

I was a senior in college at the time.  I was already working all day every day due to my coursework (I was a computer science and cyber security double major) and my job as a Resident Assistant (RA for short).  

I was sent back home like everyone.  

My teachers told me the course work would be differnt since everyone did not know what was going to happen.  I basically coasted to the finish line.  I had so much free time I did not know what to do.  

I decided I would learn a new skill.  That skill is Machine Learning.  I absolutley love it.  It is what I want to do.  These projects are very fun to me and I enjoy sharing them.  

I am working on a perosnal website to house everything I do.  Stay tuned for that.

I wanted to put my new skills to the test.  I am practicing what I learn in a course with the help of Kaggle datasets.  I am preparing for the TensorFlow Developer Certificate and Computer Vision is an aspect of it.  This project felt appropriate since I learned these skills during the lockdowns and I am still learning today.  Being able to wake up and genuinely feel excited to do what I do is a feeling I have never experienced.  That is enough about me, let's get into the code in the code folder ðŸ˜‚.

This is a work in progress so it will be updated over time!
